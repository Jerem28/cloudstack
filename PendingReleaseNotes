  * After testing Mac OS last versions (above 10.12) with Vmware Hypervisor,
    it seems that this OS has some compatibility issues with default Cloudstack hardware 
    profile (that is to say, with LSI Logic Parallel SCSI Disk Controller and E1000 Network card). 
    To make it work, we set up a different profil for Mac OS virtual machines.
  * One SATA Controller is now defined as default hardware profil when using 
    Vmware VSphere Hypervisor, instead of usual 4 SCSI controllers. Also, 
    instead of E1000 Nic Adapter, Mac OS virtual machine are now set up 
    with E1000E network adapter by default.
